2 FASTQ file paths in input
2 valid fastq names.
Detect only single multiplex group in each plate, will use V2-single mode.
Demultiplexing raw FASTQ
Merging lanes to get cell FASTQ
Reformat directories to separate multiplex groups
Skip 0 cells due to too less input read pairs (< 1)
Skip 0 cells due to too large input read pairs (> 6000000)

IF YOU USE QSUB ON GALE: 
All snakemake commands need to be executed were included in /gpfs/home/asun/jin_lab/yap/pipeline2_yap_iseq0328/yap_demultiplex/snakemake/qsub/qsub.sh
You just need to qsub this script to map the whole library in /gpfs/home/asun/jin_lab/yap/pipeline2_yap_iseq0328/yap_demultiplex
You can also change the per job parameters in /gpfs/home/asun/jin_lab/yap/pipeline2_yap_iseq0328/yap_demultiplex/snakemake/qsub/snakemake_cmd.txt or change the global parameters in /gpfs/home/asun/jin_lab/yap/pipeline2_yap_iseq0328/yap_demultiplex/snakemake/qsub/qsub.sh
Read 'yap qsub -h' if you want to have more options about sbatch. Alternatively, you can sbatch the commands in /gpfs/home/asun/jin_lab/yap/pipeline2_yap_iseq0328/yap_demultiplex/snakemake/qsub/snakemake_cmd.txt by yourself, as long as they all get successfully executed.

For running jobs on the STAMPEDE2 normal queue:
All snakemake commands need to be executed were included in /gpfs/home/asun/jin_lab/yap/pipeline2_yap_iseq0328/yap_demultiplex/snakemake/sbatch/sbatch-normal-queue.sh
You just need to run this script to map the whole library in /gpfs/home/asun/jin_lab/yap/pipeline2_yap_iseq0328/yap_demultiplex. Note that this script will not return until all the mapping job finished. So you better run this script with nohup or in a screen.
You can also change the per job parameters in /gpfs/home/asun/jin_lab/yap/pipeline2_yap_iseq0328/yap_demultiplex/snakemake/sbatch/snakemake_normal_cmd.txt or change the global parameters in /gpfs/home/asun/jin_lab/yap/pipeline2_yap_iseq0328/yap_demultiplex/snakemake/sbatch/sbatch-normal-queue.sh
Read 'yap sbatch -h' if you want to have more options about sbatch. Alternatively, you can sbatch the commands in /gpfs/home/asun/jin_lab/yap/pipeline2_yap_iseq0328/yap_demultiplex/snakemake/sbatch/sbatch.sh by yourself, as long as they all get successfully executed.

Once all commands are executed successfully, use 'yap summary' to generate final mapping summary.
